                    <p class="lead"><br>Last week an editorial was published in the Emory Wheel regarding the replacement of Einstein Bros. Bagels with Dunkin’ Donuts. We agree with the Editorial Board that although a Dunkin’ Donuts may “bring new life into campus dining” this clashes with Emory’s efforts to encourage students to live healthier lifestyles.<br>

                    <br>In the past few years, across college campuses nationwide, there has been great interest in the Freshman 15—a phenomenon describing student weight gain during the first year of college. However, recent findings by Dr. Jay Zagorsky at Ohio State University suggest that the Freshman 15 is actually a myth. Instead, he found that freshmen only gain 2 to 3 pounds. Although this appears insignificant, this increase could be reflective of poor dietary habits or lifestyle choices of college freshmen, which could prove harmful later in life.<br>

                    <br>Being freshmen, these results intrigued us, leading us to study the dietary habits and lifestyle changes in college freshmen. Our project began as part of the freshman seminar ORDER (On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers). ORDER is a research-based seminar run by Professor David Lynn and Professor Leslie Taylor. With the guidance of our mentor, Dr. Dennis Mishler, our study began in fall 2011. We collected data from first year students who live in the Longstreet-Means residence hall and, with the assistance of Dr. Michelle Lampl and Dr. Jill Welkley, freshmen enrolled in Health 100. The 125 participants were anonymously surveyed with questions related to eating habits, physical activity, and general lifestyles.<br>

                    <br>From this dataset, we noted several correlations. Our findings indicated that over two-thirds of those surveyed had a normal BMI (Body Mass Index), suggesting that Emory’s freshmen class is relatively healthy when it comes to weight. Furthermore, the freshmen with “overweight” BMI scores were predominantly athletes and physically active freshmen, suggesting that they were not overweight, but simply had more muscle mass.  Despite the high number of freshmen having a healthy BMI, our findings suggest at least one potential health concern.  The transition from high school to college was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in athletic participation. This drop in athletic participation is particularly substantial among females and Asians/Pacific Islanders with a decrease of over 50% for each group.<br>

                    <br>Our initial findings did not show any strong nutrition trends.  We wanted to inquire in more detail the eating habits and food choices of the freshmen class. We continued our study by recording the food selection of freshmen at the DUC (Dobbs University Center) for one hour during dinner for one week in the spring semester. The data collected from the DUC support our previous finding that Emory freshmen are healthy with eating habits that appear to be nutritionally balanced.<br>

                    <br>Overall, we concluded that Emory freshmen are relatively healthy compared to other universities.  However, we are unsure whether this is a result of a healthy lifestyle or the required meal plan.  Nevertheless, a required meal plan makes having healthy dining options on campus of utmost importance, and as far as we can tell the DUC is largely accomplishing this.<br>

                    <br>Currently there are several healthy options available but upcoming changes might threaten the balance.  It seems contradictory to have a Dunkin’ Donuts in the middle of campus, whereas healthy dining options, such as Organic-To-Go, are located on the outskirts of campus.  We are not proposing to move Organic-To-Go to the DUC, but why not simply have two Organic-To-Go restaurants: one for the general Emory population, and one for those on the outskirts of campus.<br>

                    <br>When it comes to living a healthy lifestyle, there must be a healthy environment.  This includes the availability of healthy food and physical education programs.  A Freshmen Olympics amongst first year residence halls would promote physical activity and a sense of community.  With regards to the DUC, we observed there were insufficient fruit options.  By having more prepared fruit available throughout the day, students would have healthier eating choices.  By implementing positive changes such as these, we, the Emory community, can promote a healthy environment.<br>

                    <br>Since there will always be changes to the Emory environment, we plan to conduct further studies on the health of Emory undergraduates in the coming academic year.  If you have any questions, concerns, or an interest in our study, please contact us.  We gladly welcome any advice, suggestions, or assistance. After all, we are all members of the Emory community.
